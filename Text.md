Game inputs:
if input = p. Pause time
if input = i. show inventorie (layout will come later)
if input = m. display map.
Enter = Skip text, buy something in a shop, yes.
Back/delete botton = Skip text, No and back.(back in the sense of, so if they input i to show inventorie they can either click back or I
again and both will remove the inventorie.

´5 possible basic outputs:

age 11-18-School.

age 11-18-Homeschool.

age 18+ Homeless.

age 18+ still living home.

age 18+ moved away.

Logic to be aware of:

When they start in school. they will have to schoose "x" lessons they want to have each day.
English and math is obligated no matter what.

for each year he goes up the lesson will drop automaticly unless he choose to keep some lesson or get more of a different lesson so.
year = 11
if year == 12:
  lesson -= 1
minimum of lesson is 3

if knowledge = "x"
they can procede to next year
else:
    retake year.
if school days not = "x"
  give first warning
  second warning
  third warning.
  if player gets third warning he gets expelled. and has to do either homeschool or choose not to do school at all.
if homework not = "x"
  he will have to retake the year again.

Time:
day = 24 hours
Lesson = 1 hour/60min
age 11-18. 10 hours sleep are required. if sleep is not 10 hours "mood" will drop

plus we will set from the age of 11-18 so every game week is 1 year. so it dosen´t take ages.

All this can and might be changed.
